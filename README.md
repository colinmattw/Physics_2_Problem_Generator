# Physics_2_Problem_Generator
Created an application for my Physics 2 classmates that randomly displays practice problems based on the kind of material the user wants to study.

This was developed for me and my physics classmates to help study for the final exam. This project introduced me to several new concepts in programming.
1. My first project where I had to take into account the various operating systems the user could be running.
2. My first project where the final program would be an executable and not a code file. However, I only had enough time figure this out on MAC. Windows had to run the .py file.
3. My first project developed for layman users. This means I had put extra time into debugging.
4. My first project where the code interacted significantly with the operating system. (Opened apps like Preview and MS Paint and displayed things in them).
