# Physics_2_Problem_Generator
Created an application for my Physics 2 classmates that randomly displays practice problems based on the kind of material the user wants to study.

This project introduced me to several new concepts in programming:
1. My first project where I had to take into account the various operating systems the user could be running.
2. My first project where the final program would be an executable and not a code file. However, I only had enough time figure this out on MAC. Windows had to run the .py file.
3. My first project developed for layman users. This means I had put extra time into debugging.
4. My first project where the code interacted significantly with the operating system. (Opened apps like Preview and MS Paint and displayed things in them).
5. My first project which relied heavily on string concatenation for function.

Description:

This project was developed very quickly leading up to the final exam for Physics 2 while I was still an engineering major. Users interact with the terminal, answering yes and no questions for which chapters they want to see material from. After they start. The program will open Preview or MS Paint, depending on your operating system, and display a random question from the pool of material the user wants to see from. When the user is ready to move on, the correct answer will be displayed, and a new question will appear.
